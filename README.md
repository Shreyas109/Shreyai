Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision transformers
Load the Model and Preprocessor: Use the transformers library to load the model and its corresponding preprocessor:

python
Copy code
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification, ViTImageProcessor
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load the model
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('prithivMLmods/Deep-Fake-Detector-Model')

# Load the preprocessor
processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('prithivMLmods/Deep-Fake-Detector-Model')
Prepare the Input Image: Open and preprocess the image you want to analyze:

python
Copy code
# Open an image file
image = Image.open('path_to_your_image.jpg')

# Preprocess the image
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
Perform Inference: Pass the preprocessed image through the model to obtain predictions:

python
Copy code
# Ensure the model is in evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get predicted class
predicted_class = outputs.logits.argmax(-1).item()
Interpret the Results: The predicted_class will be an integer corresponding to the model's output classes. You should map this integer to the actual class labels used during the model's training to determine whether the image is real or a deepfake.
